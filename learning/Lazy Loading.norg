In case of client side routing and creating a single page application, the whole code for entire application arrives to the client side. The whole bundle

However rather than sending the entire app at once, we lazy load the page and send only the required details when they need to be loaded.

The extra syntax for this is
@code javascript
  const Dashbaord = React.lazy(()=> import ("./components/Dashboard"))
@end

For this to work, the component need to be `default` export
